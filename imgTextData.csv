Hi there, hope you're having a great <span id="day"></span>
I'm Will, these are the things that matter to me - in <span id="imgCount"></span> pictures. People, animals, things, hobbies and memories.
Dave
My first cat. One of my favourite images of him wearing a garter. He currently lives with my mum and his mini cat family.
Vesuvius, Italy
Forgot to check the weather before hiking to the top. Thunderstorm looming.
Berny-Rivière, France
Explored the creepy lime caves in the area with a friend. I think it says 'satan is our master'.
Snowboarding
Snowboarding is excellent. Painful at times but excellent.
Alana
My best friend.
Eyjafjallajökull, Iceland
Yea, I can't pronounce it either. This is the glacier with a volcano underneath, see the ash?
Programming
Wouldn't be on this course if I didn't enjoy programming.
Triglav, Slovenia
2,864m, a dangerous climb. We got there in the end. Sit in that hut and get spanked with the rope inside and you're a 'true Slovenian'.
Berlin, Germany
One of my favourite cities. Ich bin ein Berliner
Einstein
He's super young here. Used to bang his head a lot.
Chernobyl, Ukraine
Here in 2016 if I remember correctly, beautiful really but a stark reminder of the dangers.
Mt Dachstein, Austria
2,995m, out for a stroll. Vertically...
Gaming
Thought I was going to grow out of this. Nope. Still love it. Recently playing 'Fall Guys' and 'COD MW'. Fun fact, Fall Guys was developed in the UK, in Uxbridge.
Fort De La Chartreuse, Belgium
I have a thing for exploring abandoned places. The govt are letting nature take this one back as part of a study.
Gotokuji Temple, Japan
And I thought I liked cats. The story goes a cat saved the Lord from a sudden thunderstorm.
I know, more ice cream
There's going to be quite a bit of ice cream here. This one cost $4. That's my face when I'm wondering if I may have gone too far.
Pika Pika!!
Race go karts across Tokyo city streets dressed as Pikachu!? Sign me up (and they did).
Fushimi Inari-taisha, Japan
Japan has a special place in my heart. Such an incredible country. This is one of the many shrines dotted around.
Electric Vehicles
I was never into cars until EVs started to rise in popularity. This is mine, it's called Volty McVoltface.
The Rabbit Island
This was taken on Ōkunoshima island in Japan which is overrun with rabbits. It was an amazing day to walk the island and feed them. Animal welfare is important to me.  
Exploring
My biggest hobby is definitely travelling and exploring new places. These are the bog lands of Latvia.
Tymbark
This is a Polish soft drink. It's apple and mint, you'd think that'd be a bit weird but it tastes amazing.
Flying
I love flying but my stomach would disagree. I took this before taking my first flight and subsequently threw up 3 times in the air.
Kayaking
I can't get enough of Kayaking especially in scenes like this. I think this was Hungary.
Corvinilor
More exploring, this time castles. This was a particularly impressive one in Romania.
Cirque de Gavarnie
The outdoors has some spectacular sites. Cirque de Gavarnie is in the Pyrenees and is an incredible place.
Gaming PCs
I spent a year running my own mini business building and selling gaming pcs and parts. Did well and enjoyed it a lot.
Yep that's another Ice Cream
I think this was in Venice - *dribbles*.
Electronics repair
I'm self taught and by no means seriously experienced but I do enjoy repairing electronics.
Soldering
Took a long time to become good at this but I enjoy soldering too - well I guess I have to if I want to actually repair anything.
Einstein!!!
Here he is poking out of his cat tower in the living room. He's trying to coax me into putting my hands inside so he can shred them.
Motorbikes
Ok yes another ice cream but I do like motorbikes. I had motorbikes for over 8 years. This was my last one, a Yamaha R6. I do miss them sometimes.
Hiking and Climbing
This is the view of a final ascent at the peak of Biokovo in Croatia. Chilly up there. The metal line is called via ferrata which climbers clip themselves to for safety. In English - 'iron path'.
The abandoned
This used to be a 5 star hotel near the border of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Destroyed through conflict but an amazing place to explore, probably one of the best abandoned sites I've been to.
Zip Lines
So much fun! I love them. These are in Croatia. A bad start to the day though, someone cloned my card and took £450 off me. Soon perked up on these. 
Holidays
Explore, explore, explore...
Denmark
I somehow forget many of the places I've been but never where I ate an ice cream.
Up in the mountains
Great place to be, good exercise and away from civilisation. One of my most enjoyed hobbies. Slovakia if I remember correctly.
Delays
Not usually much fun but the crew were kind enough to ask if anyone wanted to sit in the cockpit. I was up and running before the children got a word in. Planes? Trains? EVs? Yep I'm in!
Gorges
I'm facinated by gorges for some reason. Maybe it's the vast rock or the silence I'm not sure. I just love visiting them. Austria this was - no shortage of gorges.
Sweets
You may not have guessed with all the ice cream that I do have a sweet tooth. Minky Binky is just the best name for sweets.
Reading
I do like reading but don't do it often enough. This entire staircase is made of books.
I'm sorry
It's the last one I swear and yes I take pictures of every ice cream I eat whilst away.
Pinball demon
I was 34 when I played my first pinball machine! This is from the The Flipper Museum in Hungary.
More abandoned places
I'm not sure why abandoned places grab so much of my attention but they're so much fun to explore. Safety first! Sort of...
Food Markets
Outdoor food markets are great and I love weaving through them exploring what's on offer. 
Shooting
Probably not everyones cup of tea which I understand but I do enjoy target shooting. Put an M4 in my hands and I'm a happy man. Ironically this is an AK47.
Food
So much talk of ice cream up to this point I forgot to mention food. J'adore food.
Pizza?
Just got to give a special mention to pizza for being in existance.
Sunsets
Seen some incredible ones and love watching the sky flood with colours. Hopefully will return to Japan one day to see the sun rise from Fuji.
Road trips
As much as driving tires me out I love road trips. I've driven over a significant portion of Europe by car and love. This was in the outback of Latvia.
Trains
I know so little about them but I'm facinated by their size and speed. This TGV took me to Luxembourg, flying along at 200mph!
Clay Pigeon Shooting
Such fun shooting clays, never gets old. Looking like I was having one of my better days here.
I love gooooooooold...
I don't really, I just always wanted to say that. Austin Powers? No? Ok lets move on.
Family Time
A normal family Christmas, no horsing around whatsoever.
German Christmas Markets
One of my absolute favourite things about Christmas is visiting Germany to see the German Christmas Markets. I think this was taken near Alexanderplatz.
Knofel
This is my number one restaurant in the whole world located in Berlin. Everything... EVERYTHING is served with garlic, yes, even the ice cream!
Norway
I hope to move here or very close one day. A special place in my heart for Norway.
Art
Zero interest as a child, zero interest as a teen but as I mature I'm beginning to find art I can appreciate. This piece was at a modern art museum in Slovakia.
